# News Reading Video/Audio Generator - Requirements

## Overview
Create a system that fetches the top news of the day from selected sources, generates a summary (top 5 points), and produces an audio or video output where the news is read aloud. The system should support multiple languages, allow source selection (such as cnn, nbc), and include features like intro music, intermissions, and time control for playback.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. News Fetching
- Fetch top news of the day (top 5 points) from major news sources (e.g., CNN, BBC, Fox News, etc.).
- Allow users to pick and choose their preferred news sources (e.g., "I want Fox News, not BBC").
- Support creating the audio and video news in different languages
- Minimize the number of AI API calls to keep costs down (e.g., cache results, batch requests).

### 2. News Processing
- Summarize the news into the top 5 points for each selected source.
- Store the generated news summaries in a storage bucket for later retrieval.

### 3. Audio Generation
- Convert the news summaries into audio using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.
- Support different voices (e.g., male and female) for a conversational style.
- Allow the user to specify the duration of the audio playback (e.g., "play for 30 minutes").
- Include news-style intro music and intermissions between segments.

### 5. Playback
- Allow users to play the generated audio or video.
- Support playback controls (pause, resume, skip intermission, etc.).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Cost Efficiency:** Minimize API and cloud storage costs (e.g., by caching, batching, and reusing generated content).
- **Scalability:** System should be able to handle multiple users and requests.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new news sources or languages.
- **User Experience:** Simple interface for selecting sources, languages, and playback options.

---

## Stretch Goals
- Personalization (e.g., "I want more sports news").
- Integration with smart speakers or mobile apps.
- Real-time news updates. 

today: just want the audio from notebook lm, downloading it from the s3 bucket (fully api driven), generate the audio using those libraries (say, movie, etc.)not the video
tomorrow: 
click on play button, will play the audio file.

## Infrastructure: S3 Bucket Provisioning

Below is a sample AWS CloudFormation YAML to provision an S3 bucket for storing audio files generated by the system:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: S3 bucket for storing news audio files
Resources:
  NewsAudioBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: newsapp-audio-bucket-<unique-suffix>
      AccessControl: Private
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true
Outputs:
  NewsAudioBucketName:
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket for audio files
    Value: !Ref NewsAudioBucket
```

- Replace `<unique-suffix>` with a globally unique string (e.g., your project or account ID).
- This bucket is private and versioned for safety.
- Adjust permissions as needed for your use case (e.g., allow read access via signed URLs).
